Place the RFC library you downloaded from SAP in one of the subfolders
of this folder. Put it in:

    gnulinux/    If you are on a GNU/Linux system
    osx/         If you are on a macintosh
    windows/     UNTESTED.

The directory structure in gnulinux/, osx/, etc. should look like this:

    hc@calvo ~/c/r/saprfc (master)> ls -l gnulinux/
    total 16
    drwxr-xr-x  3 hc  users    96 Dec 30 11:13 META-INF/
    -rw-r--r--  1 hc  users  7885 Dec 30 11:13 SIGNATURE.SMF
    drwxr-xr-x  7 hc  users   224 Dec 30 11:13 nwrfcsdk/

We cannot supply this library due to SAP licensing issues. You will
need a customer/partner account and download directly from SAP.
